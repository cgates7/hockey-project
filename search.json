    "text": "In simple terms, most hockey legends hit their “goal-scoring prime” between the ages of 24 and 27. This is the biological sweet spot where a player’s physical explosive power, reaction speed, and professional experience all peak at the same time. During these years, superstars like Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux were scoring at a rate that seemed almost unfair, often averaging nearly a goal every single game.\nHowever, the “all-time” leaders are special because they found ways to stay productive long after their physical peak. While most players see their scoring drop off a cliff after age 30, Alex Ovechkin became a mathematical anomaly; he continued to score like a 25-year-old well into his late 30s. Essentially, while Gretzky had the highest “mountain top” (scoring a record 92 goals in a single season at age 21), Ovechkin created the longest “high plateau,” staying near his peak for twice as long as the average player. Gordie Howe took a third path, using extreme longevity to keep scoring consistently until he was over 50 years old, proving that in hockey, you can reach the top through either a massive burst of brilliance or a lifelong marathon of steady work."
